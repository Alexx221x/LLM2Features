## LLM2FEATURES: LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS IN AUTOMATIC FEATURE GENERATION FOR AUTOML AND INTERPRETATION WITH TABULAR DATA

* LLM2Features dir - generated features by the approach from the paper
* actor_prompt.py - main prompt for feature generation
* critic_prompt.py - LLM critic's prompt for correcting LLM actor errors
* check_features_ast.py - A three-line example of checking the correctness of the generated code, not counting the LLM critic
